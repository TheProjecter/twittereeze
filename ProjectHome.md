**Twittereeze** is a SIMBL (_Smart InputManager Bundle Loader_) extension for Twitterrific (freeware), a Mac OS X client for the Twitter service. Twittereeze aims to improve Twitterrific's user experience in small ways.

While Twitterrific itself is a nice little app to send and receive 'tweets', i.e. change your own status and stay up-to-date on that of others, I primarily use Twitter in a similar manner to an IM network's status message. Thanks to AppleScript, the status messages of iChat (AIM/.mac/ICQ, Jabber/Google Talk/LiveJournal), Skype and Adium (many, many protocols) can be changed through a simple API. With Twittereeze enabled, any status that Twitterrific sends to Twitter as a 'tweet' automatically becomes your status on those three applications as well, provided you have them running.

Moreover, Twittereeze makes the 'What are you doing?' text field frontmost (except when it doesn't make sense), so you can typically type right away, and it adds the following keyboard shortcuts:
  * `cmd-F11` for globally toggling the Twitterrific window (and, where applicable, making it frontmost)
  * `cmd-shift-F11` for globally making the Twitterrific window frontmost
  * `ctrl-up` and `ctrl-down` for navigating the list of recent tweets while the 'What are you doing?' text field is frontmost.
In a nutshell, it eliminates many, many cases of having to unnecessarily switch between keyboard and mouse to use the interface.

I'm releasing this in the hope that it will be as useful to others as it has been to me.

Twittereeze requires a Twitter account and Twitterrific as well as an installed SIMBL. It currently comes with no preferences of its own; the aforementioned shortcuts are thus far hardcoded.
